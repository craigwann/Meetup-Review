## Portland Ruby Brigade

1. What was the name of the tech event? What date did it occur?
```
Portland Ruby Brigade on 08/07/2018 from 6:30—8:30pm.
```
1. Who/what organization coordinated the event? If there were speakers, who spoke?
```
New Relic
Michael Smith - Principal Engineer @ Puppet Labs
Zach Davis - Chief Technologist @ Cast Iron Coding
Lauren Voswinkel - Senior Software Engineer @ New Relic
Reid Beels - CTO @ The Dyrt
```
1. What was the format of the event?
```
It was a panel discussion.
```
1. What was the topic or main focus of the event?
```
The intended broad overview of the future of Ruby with
most of the content being questions from
people in attendance.
```

1. What made you want to attend this particular event?
```
I was a little apprehensive about my choice of Ruby as
a programming language to learn and what actual employment
opportunities exist.
```
1. What was the highlight of the event?
```
For me, the highlights were the social aspect
(+free pizza, beer/wine) and not being the oldest
person in the room (^_^). Not to forget the venue
itself. It was on the 27th floor at New Relic's
kitchen/gathering area, fantastic environment.
```
1. What did you learn from this experience?
```
They quelled my concerns about Ruby as programming
language. As it may not be the 'shiny new thing' in
tech, like many perceived trends. It's not going away
anytime soon, in fact version 3 will be coming out soon
(no dates given). I've ordered a suggested book
'Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby'-Sandi Metz.
```
1. If you could give feedback to the coordinators of the event, what would it be? (Many events send out surveys and ask for feedback. Giving constructive feedback is a great way to contribute to the tech community.)
```
Overall, it was a very positive experience and left
feeling proud to be part of the community.
```
1. Would you recommend the event (or a similar event) to your peers?
```
Of course. I plan making this particular meetup a regular event.
```
1. Is there anything else that stood out about the event? Please feel free to add additional notes.
```
Again, I don't know if Epicodus has a marketing dept. and what brand awareness was prior to that meetup...everyone there knew about Epicodus by the end thanks to the many questions asked by Reese and Annie.
